# Image-Classification-for-Polarized-Image

This project aims at detecting the material (plastic/chong/metal) based on one image.

Step 1. Prepare dataset

- Dividing the image into three parts: plastic, chong, metal. 
- Transfering the source image and three material images into .npy files.

Step 2. Polarize the three images

- Polarize the image using the Neural Network

Step 3. Train-Test-Split to prepare datasets for image classification
